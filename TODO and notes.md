## TODO
- validation (ideally both client- and server- side) that the date given isn't in the future (or too far in the past?)
- stop it from breaking if server-side required-fields-exist validation fails and it does the `flash`.

- [modals for an item view instead of a separate `/item/<int:id>` route](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15nM9X0eWFdvy0PJBg230Rwo3XFstrA24aJVE9tW1lio/edit#heading=h.go2a2g6fa62b)
